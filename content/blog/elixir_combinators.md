## Combinatory Logic & The SK(I) Combinator Calculus

This is a **paragraph** with some additional text ðŸ˜„ and also some _`verbatim text`_. What happens if a line goes longer, I wonder? Where do we hit the newline word wrap? Does it stop widening the main text area?

$\lnot P \land \lnot Q = \lnot (P \lor Q)$

$\lnot P \lor \lnot Q = \lnot (P \land Q)$

Looks like math doesn't render currently ðŸ˜¦.

## The Primary Combinators

These combinators are being defined uncurried as Elixir doesn't use the automatic currying approach.
In many contexts, the power of combinators is best expressed in an ML/Miranda descended language or
and array language like APL, J, or BQN.

- I
- Identity
- Id
- Idiot
- Ibis

<!--can do `elixir,linenos,linenostart=10,hl_lines=3-4 8-9,hide_lines=2 7`-->

```elixir
# a -> a
def idiot(a) do
  a
end
```

- K
- Kestrel
- Constant
- True
- Left

```elixir
# a -> b -> a
def kestrel(a, b) do
  a
end
```

- S
- Schmeltzen, 'to fuse'
- Starling
- ap
- <\*>

```elixir
# (a -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
def starling(a, b, c) do
  a(c, b(c))
end
```
