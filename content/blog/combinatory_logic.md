## Combinatory Logic & The SK(I) Combinator Calculus

This is a **paragraph** with some additional text ðŸ˜„ and also some _`verbatim text`_. What happens if a line goes longer, I wonder? Where do we hit the newline word wrap? Does it stop widening the main text area?

$\lnot P \land \lnot Q = \lnot (P \lor Q)$

$\lnot P \lor \lnot Q = \lnot (P \land Q)$

Looks like math does render currently ðŸ˜„.

## The Primary Combinators

These combinators are being defined uncurried as Elixir doesn't use the automatic currying approach.
In many contexts, the power of combinators is best expressed in an ML/Miranda descended language or
and array language like APL, J, or BQN.

- I
- Identity
- Id
- Idiot
- Ibis

<!--can do `elixir,linenos,linenostart=10,hl_lines=3-4 8-9,hide_lines=2 7`-->

```scm
;; a -> a
(define I
  (Î» (a) (a)))
```

- K
- Kestrel
- Constant
- True
- Left

```scm
;; a -> b -> a
(define K
  (curry 
    (Î» (a b) (a))))
```

- S
- Schmeltzen, 'to fuse'
- Starling
- ap
- <\*>

```scm
;; (a -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
(define S
  (curry 
    (Î» (a b c) (a c (b c)))))
```
