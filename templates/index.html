<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Matthew Mark Ibbetson. I'm a software developer with preference for
  functional programming and a passion for programming language design and
  history. My primary languages of interest are Lisp, Elixir, and Rust.
  Occupationally, I work mostly with TypeScript and C#.
</p>
<p>
  My open-source software projects are largely centered around plaintext
  workflow tools, such as the
  <a href="https://github.com/mmibbetson/dn" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="noreferrer">
    <code>dn</code> note-taking tool
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="https://github.com/mmibbetson/litr" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="noreferrer">
    <code>litr</code> literate programming tool </a
  >. Otherwise, my programming interests aim toward creating soft-real-time,
  self-healing, scalable, concurrent systems with the BEAM.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of programming, I am an avid music enthusiast and novice audiophile; I
  enjoy reading and writing short-form literature and occasionally taking
  pictures with my Fujifilm Instax Mini 40. I have also recently taken to
  recreational logic and mathematics.
</p>
<p>
  I can be reached via
  <a href="mailto:mmibbetson@gmail.com" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="noreferrer"> email </a>
  and be found with the username "mmibbetson" wherever I have an account.
