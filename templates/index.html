<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Matthew Mark Ibbetson. I'm a software developer with preference for functional programming 
  and a passion for programming language design and history.

  My primary languages of interest (in no particular order) are Rust, Elixir, and Lisp 
  (particularly Guile, Fennel, and Janet). Occupationally, I work mostly with TypeScript and C#.
</p>
<p>
  My open-source software projects are largely centered around plaintext workflow tools, such as the 
  <a><code>dn</code> note-taking tool</a> and the <a><code>litr</code> literate programming tool</a>.
  Otherwise, my programming interests aim toward creating soft-real-time, self-healing, scalable, 
  concurrent systems with the BEAM.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of programming, I am an avid music enthusiast and novice audiophile; I enjoy reading and 
  writing short-form literature and occasionally taking pictures with my Fujifilm Instax Mini 40. 
  I have also recently taken to recreational logic and mathematics.
</p>
<p>
  I can be reached via <a>email</a> and be found with the username "mmibbetson" wherever I have an
  account.
</p>
