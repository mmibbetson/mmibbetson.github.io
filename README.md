# Untitled Personal Blog Site

## Building

There is a `build.sh` script in the `src/` directory which builds the project with [Zola]() into the `docs/` directory at the root of the git project. The purpose of building to this directory specifically is that GitHub is able to serve the contents of that directory as the sources for the free GitHub Pages site which is currently used to host the blog.
